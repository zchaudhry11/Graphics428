Part C:
The difference in the results of Part A and Part B is that Part A involves collision 
between properly defined convex shapes whereas Part B involves two shapes which are 
self-intersecting and concave. In order to fix the polygons2.xml testcase, one can 
move the vertex definitions around so that the edges are drawn in an order that 
prevents self-intersection which can be seen from the culling errors. Afterwards, one 
can do any changes that would turn the concave shape into a convex one. We simply 
removed an existing vertex and moved one of the other vertices in order to obtain a 
convex shape. After doing this, the test case now works as expected.
