Part C:
The difference in the results of Part A and Part B is that Part A involves collision between properly defined convex shapes whereas Part B involves two shapes which are self-intersecting and concave. In order to fix the polygons2.xml testcase, one can move the vertex definitions around so that the edges are drawn in an order that prevents self-intersection which can be seen from the culling errors. Afterwards, one can do any changes that would turn the concave shape into a convex one. We simply removed an existing vertex and moved one of the other vertices in order to obtain a convex shape. After doing this, the test case now works as expected.
